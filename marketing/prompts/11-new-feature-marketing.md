# Create a marketing video when a new feature ships

**Feature / change:** [ENTER FEATURE OR REFERENCE PR / ISSUE / RELEASE]

Act as a release marketer, product analyst, and video producer. Read `marketing/prompts/00-video-production-rules.md`, `marketing/strategy.md`, `marketing/features.md`, `marketing/rules/video-playbook.md`, the relevant code in this repo (`internal/`, `cmd/`, `web/src/`, `ios/`), `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, and approved past videos.

1. Verify whether the feature is actually shipped (deployed through `platform/infra`, not just merged to `main`), which platforms support it (web/iOS) and which social networks, and the real user workflow. Do not advertise partially implemented or unreleased features as live.
2. Update `marketing/features.md` only with confirmed facts; update `marketing/strategy.md` only if positioning materially changes. Preserve reviewed messaging.
3. Assess whether existing full showcase/UGC videos require factual updates; flag outdated scenes, but **do not overwrite previously approved final videos**.
4. Draft one 20–30s vertical feature video following `marketing/prompts/03-create-feature-showcase.md`, with clear benefit, real workflow, and CTA.
5. Identify/capture the exact demo footage, reuse the approved video style, and prepare storyboard, narration, edit plan, social caption, and asset references.
6. Present provider/tool availability, proposed paid generations, and costs; **pause for approval before incurring charges**.
7. If approved, produce and QA actual outputs where tooling permits; otherwise deliver the production-ready assets and edit instructions. Update the campaign calendar with a suggested post, but **do not schedule or publish automatically**.
