# Plan the complete app marketing video campaign

Act as a SaaS product marketer, creative director, and video producer. Start at the **repository root** (`~/Work/production/apps/postitheka/`). This is a single repo: the Go API and publish workers (`cmd/`, `internal/`), the web composer (`web/`) and the iPhone app (`ios/`) live together, and both clients are generated from `api/openapi.yaml`.

Read `marketing/prompts/00-video-production-rules.md` and comply with it. Read `marketing/strategy.md`, `marketing/features.md`, relevant brand documents (`marketing/rules/brand.md`, `brand/README.md`), and the current `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `BACKLOG.md` and `docs/platform-rollout.md`. Consult implementation only where needed to validate product features and user flows.

## Deliverable
Design a cohesive, realistic video campaign, **without spending any Higgsfield credits yet**:
1. One **full app showcase** (45–60s, 16:9 primary, 9:16 alternate).
2. One **AI presenter / UGC-style ad** (30–45s, 9:16 primary).
3. Three **individual feature showcase videos** (20–30s, 9:16 primary).
4. One **short promotional teaser** (10–15s, 9:16 primary).

Select the top three features by user benefit, demonstrability, and current implementation status. For each video provide: specific audience, single message, objective, supported claims, opening hook, complete spoken script, timestamped storyboard, shot list tied to source screens, estimated runtime, caption text, CTA, aspect ratios, visual direction, music/sound direction, and export requirements.

Create or update `marketing/rules/video-playbook.md` with global visual identity and production standards. Create `marketing/videos/production-plan.md` and folders for each planned video. List missing footage and how to capture it. Identify which scenes require real UI footage, AI presenter, Higgsfield-generated creative assets, or ordinary compositing. Inspect tool availability and present model/credit estimates if discoverable (otherwise mark unknown). Include a cost-minimizing order of work and asset reuse plan.

Before writing, preserve any approved existing documents, especially the approved Video 1 showcase plan. Do not overwrite approved scripts without clearly proposing changes. Create the planning files now, then summarize the package and **stop for approval before any paid generation**.
